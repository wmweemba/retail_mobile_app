## State Management with Zustand

This project uses [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for global state management.

- The main store for transactions is located at `src/services/useTransactionsStore.ts`.
- Example usage:

```tsx
import { useTransactionsStore } from '../services/useTransactionsStore';

const transactions = useTransactionsStore(state => state.transactions);
const addTransaction = useTransactionsStore(state => state.addTransaction);

// Add a transaction
addTransaction({ /* ...transaction data... */ });
```

## Input Methods for Expenses & Income

Financial Copilot supports three ways to add transactions:

### 1. Manual Input
- Enter transaction details using a standard form.
- Fast and familiar for most users.

### 2. Voice Input
- Add expenses or income by speaking a command (e.g., "Add expense of 50 to groceries").
- **Technology:** Uses the Web Speech API for voice recognition and custom logic to parse commands into transaction data.
- Works best in supported browsers (Chrome, Edge, etc.).

### 3. Image Input (Receipt Scanner)
- Upload a photo of a receipt to extract transaction details automatically.
- **Technology:** Uses [Tesseract.js](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js) for client-side Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to read text from images.
- Extracted data is parsed and pre-filled in the transaction form for review.

These input methods make it easy to quickly record financial data in the way that works best for you, whether you're at your desk or on the go.
